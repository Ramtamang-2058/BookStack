# BookStack : An Online Bookstore
BookStack is a Java-based project that is currently in development, aimed at creating an online bookstore for three different types of users - end-users, vendors/booksellers, and superadmin/bookstore service providers. The project's main objective is to develop a user-friendly platform that provides customers with a seamless shopping experience. Vendors will have access to an efficient dashboard to showcase their books and manage their inventory and sales, while superadmin/bookstore service providers can use a comprehensive backend system to manage the entire bookstore. The system's goal is to create a convenient, reliable, and secure online shopping experience for all book enthusiasts, and keep improving BookStack as it is continued with its development.
